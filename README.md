## Details about the Assignments

### 1. Assignment 1
In this assignment, we implemented the Halo Exhange program with the help of MPI. The assignment consisted of implementing the program using three methods:
- Multiple MPI_Sends and MPI_Recv to transmit the data items
- MPI_Pack/MPI_Unpack and MPI_Send and MPI_Recv to transmit the multiple elements at the same time
- MPI_Send and MPI_Recv using the MPI derived datatypes
  
We compared the performance of each of the three methods, and presented a detailed study about the same. More details can be found in the Assignment 1 directory.
### 2. Assignment 2
### 3. Assignment 3
